The service at the restaurant was excellent. The staff was friendly and attentive.
The food was delicious, especially the appetizers and desserts.
The ambiance was very cozy and welcoming. I loved the decor and lighting.
Unfortunately, the main course was disappointing. It was bland and overcooked.
Overall, a mixed experience with great service and ambiance but average food.
